# CodeRooms.exe

CodeRooms.exe is a project that I did for university, which shows a visual illustration of how C#/Java memory is stored at runtime. The project is entirely made solely by me, from the initial conception and design, to the final implementation. No other people or AI tools were involved in any stage of this project, including the original idea proposal.

Although release 0.0.1 is a working product, due to tight deadlines, the code was rushed and some features that I'd like to have are missing. Therefore, I moved the entire project to the legacy folder and will be starting from scratch here. Nonetheless, the video below is a good showcase of release 0.0.1.
