This is a project that I did for university, which shows a visual illustration of how C#/Java memory is stored at runtime. Due to tight deadlines, both the code and the final product have many flaws, therefore I moved the entire project to the legacy folder and will be starting from scratch. Nonetheless, the video below is a good showcase of what has been done already. Also see release 0.0.1 if you want to try it out yourself (currently only Windows 11 has been tested, but later versions will be cross-platform).
