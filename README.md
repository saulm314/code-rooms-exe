# CodeRooms.exe

CodeRooms.exe is a project that shows a visual illustration of how C#/Java memory is stored at runtime. The project is entirely made solely by me, from the initial conception and design, to the final implementation. No other people or AI tools were involved in any stage of this project, including the original idea proposal.

Try it out here: https://saulm314.github.io/code-rooms-exe/ or download the Avalonia app in Releases.
