# CodeRooms.exe

CodeRooms.exe is a project that I did for university, which shows a visual illustration of how C#/Java memory is stored at runtime. Although release 0.0.1 is a working product, due to tight deadlines, the code was rushed and some features that I'd like to have are missing. Therefore, I moved the entire project to the legacy folder and will be starting from scratch here. Nonetheless, the video below is a good showcase of release 0.0.1.
