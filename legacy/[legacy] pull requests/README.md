This is the only part of the legacy code that was not in the original version of CodeRooms.exe.

The original CodeRooms.exe was written on my university's GitHub Enterprise Server account. At some point after, I transferred the repository to my personal GitHub - also changing the author of all commits from my uni account to my personal account.

However, some information from the original repository has been lost. Namely, there were 10 pull requests with associated GitHub comments. I could not find a quick way to transfer these to my personal GitHub account, so I'm documenting those 10 pull requests here.
