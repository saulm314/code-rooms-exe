# Comment

Takes C# code as an input, throws compilation errors where appropriate, then processes the code line by line, displaying every memory value assigned to the stack and the heap.

Although we say that this is a C# interpreter, it does not perfectly reflect C#. For example, unlike C#, the "==" operator for strings compares the references, rather than the values. Also, explicit casts between doubles and ints are required.

The interpreter supports the following features (not exhaustive; some features are potentially bugged and need to undergo testing):
- variable declaration
- variable initialisation
- reading variables
- writing to variables
- int data type
- bool data type
- double data type
- char data type
- string data type
- array data type for each of the above
- int literals
- bool literals
- double literals
- char literals (all escape sequences except those beginning with \u, \U, and \x are supported)
- string literals (no escape sequences)
- array creation by choosing a length
- array creation by specifying values
- reading elements of an array
- writing to elements of an array
- reading characters of a string
- appropriate error if attempting to write characters of a string, since strings are immutable
- reading characters of an array of strings
- appropriate error if attempting to write characters of an array of strings
- reading the length of an array
- reading the length of a string
- null literal
- setting a reference type to null
- reading a reference type whose value is null
- empty lines (just a semi-colon)
- expression evaluation
- bracket evaluation
- operation evaluation
- cast operation with the same input and output type
- cast operation on null to any reference type
- cast operation from int to double (explicit casts required)
- cast operation from double to int (explicit casts required)
- integer addition
- integer subtraction
- integer negation
- integer confirmation (opposite of negation)
- integer multiplication
- integer division
- integer remainder operator
- integer "less than" operator
- integer "less than or equal to" operator
- integer "greater than" operator
- integer "greater than or equal to" operator
- double float addition
- double float subtraction
- double float negation
- double float confirmation
- double float multiplication
- double float division
- double float "less than" operator
- double float "less than or equal to" operator
- double float "greater than" operator
- double float "greater than or equal to" operator
- Boolean "and" operator
- Boolean conditional "and" operator
- Boolean "or" operator
- Boolean conditional "or" operator
- Boolean "xor" operator
- Boolean negation
- equality operator for all data types (for reference types, the reference is compared)
- inequality operator for all data types (with the same caveat)
- correct order of operations when evaluating expressions
- chaining unary operators
- single-line if statements
- multiple-line if statements
- single-line else statements
- multiple-line else statements
- single-line while loops
- multiple-line while loops
- single-line for loops
- multiple-line for loops
- optional for loop parameters
- break statement
- continue statement
- automatic scope assignment
- automatic scope dissociation
- automatic garbage collection
- automatic resizing of the heap as needed
